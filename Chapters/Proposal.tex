\chapter{Airlines Delay and Cancellation Prediction Optimization for DXB}

\section{Problem Space}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        Plane delays and cancellations are a huge inconvenience, not only for the passengers, crew and pilots flying but also for the 
        airline who incurs financial losses due tp the delays and the airport who were expecting the resources allocated 
        to the plane to be free. 
    }
    \item{
        A solution where delays could be detected ahead of time by all parties can help with planning that while may not be able to 
        prevent it, can minimize the cost financial or otherwise to all parties.
    }
    \item{
        However current prediction software is not verry accurate as it is inherantly difficult to gather data that correlates
        to delays or cancellations.
    }

\section{Hypothesis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most of the Research as well as data set links above are 2+ years old. Using newer machine learning models and with the current abundance of data we could not only produce more accurate results but could potentially produce them faster
